        <p>
            I am currently a student at Zetech University taking Bachelor Of Scence in Information Technology.
            Before then, I took Computer as a subject during my last to years of High school.
            I am also taking the ALX software enineering coure online.
            I am expected to submit my final project in Janary and graduate in March.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have maintained high grades 
            and actively sought opportunities to deepen my understanding of software development.
