        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Java, C++, and C. 
            I have hands-on experience with development tools and frameworks like React.
            In addition to technical expertise, my soft skills have been developed through group projects, presentations, and teamwork.
            I am adept at effective communication and collaboration in diverse environments. Outside of my academic pursuits, 
            I find joy in playing basketball, a passion that not only keeps me physically active but also fosters teamwork, strategy, and resilience.
            This blend of technical acumen and interpersonal skills reflects my commitment to being a well-rounded individual in both my academic and personal pursuits.
