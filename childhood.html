        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            During my formative years, my childhood was marked by a series of events that significantly influenced my career trajectory.
            Growing up, I was fascinated by the rapidly evolving world of technology. One pivotal moment occurred when I was introduced to a computer for the first time at the age of 10.
            The endless possibilities and the ability to create and solve problems captivated me. While initially, I envisioned a future in law due to an early exposure to legal dramas, 
            my perspective shifted as I explored the limitless potential of technology. An influential event was when I encountered a family friend who worked in the IT industry,
            sparking my curiosity about coding and software development. This encounter planted the seed that eventually led me to reconsider my career path, redirecting my passion 
            towards a future in Information Technology. The excitement of crafting solutions through programming became a defining aspect of my childhood, laying the foundation for my journey
            into the world of technology and shaping my aspirations in ways I hadn't imagined during those early years.
